    <p class="lead">
        When you're building a startup, you need to move fast, keep costs low, and build something that works.
        This is where full-stack developers shine. As someone who's worked with startups across Bath, Bristol,
        and the UK, I've seen the difference it makes.
    </p>

    <h2>The Startup Reality</h2>
    <p>
        Early-stage startups typically can't afford (and don't need) a full team of specialists. You don't need:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A dedicated backend developer</li>
        <li>A separate frontend developer</li>
        <li>A DevOps engineer</li>
        <li>A database administrator</li>
        <li>A system architect</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        You need one person (or a small team) who can handle all of this. That's a full-stack developer.
    </p>

    <h2>Speed of Development</h2>
    <p>
        When one person handles the entire stack, things move faster:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No handoff delays:</strong> No waiting for the backend API to be ready before frontend work can start</li>
        <li><strong>No communication overhead:</strong> No meetings to discuss API contracts or data structures</li>
        <li><strong>Faster iteration:</strong> See a problem? Fix it immediately, across the entire stack</li>
        <li><strong>Better context:</strong> Understanding the full system leads to better decisions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Small MVPs can frequently be built much more quickly by a single developer as a result.
    </p>

    <h2>The Full-Stack Advantage</h2>
    <p>
        A good full-stack developer brings:
    </p>

    <h3>Backend Expertise</h3>
    <p>
        Building robust APIs, designing databases, implementing business logic, handling authentication,
        managing queues and background jobs. This is where I spend most of my time and where I'm strongest.
    </p>

    <h3>Frontend Capability</h3>
    <p>
        While I'm not a designer, I can build functional, responsive frontends. I work with designers
        when needed, but can often build MVPs without one initially.
    </p>

    <h3>Infrastructure Knowledge</h3>
    <p>
        Setting up servers, configuring databases, managing deployments, monitoring performance.
        All the DevOps stuff that startups need but can't afford to hire for.
    </p>

    <h2>When to Specialize</h2>
    <p>
        As your startup grows, you might eventually choose to bring in specialists:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To speed up progress:</strong> It can be helpful to allow individuals to focus on frontend or backend, or certain priority features</li>
        <li><strong>When the project becomes too large:</strong> The project may simply be too big for one person to continue to support</li>
        <li><strong>For business continuity:</strong> Once budget allows, having multiple people familiar with the codebase reduces risk</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        But in the early stages, a full-stack developer gets you further, faster, for less money.
    </p>

    <h2>The Handoff Strategy</h2>
    <p>
        One approach I use with growing startups:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Early stage:</strong> I handle everything - backend, frontend, infrastructure</li>
        <li><strong>Growth stage:</strong> I focus on backend (my strength), hand off frontend and other peripheral areas</li>
        <li><strong>Scale stage:</strong> I maintain core backend, manage a growing team of developers and slowly hand off resonsibilities to others.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        This allows the startup to grow their team gradually while maintaining continuity.
    </p>

    <h2>What to Look For</h2>
    <p>
        When hiring a full-stack developer for your startup, look for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Backend strength:</strong> This is where most complexity lives</li>
        <li><strong>Problem-solving ability:</strong> Startups have unique challenges</li>
        <li><strong>Communication skills:</strong> They'll be your primary technical contact</li>
        <li><strong>Startup experience:</strong> Understanding of constraints and priorities</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability awareness:</strong> Building for now, planning for growth</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>
        For early-stage startups, a full-stack developer is often the perfect fit. You get speed, cost efficiency,
        and someone who understands the entire system. As you grow, you can add specialists while the full-stack
        developer maintains the core backend.
